# koka-bun

## System requirements

This template relies on both [Koka](https://koka-lang.github.io/) and [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

I've only tested this on Linux, but it should also work on Mac. Windows support is unlikely but on the roadmap.

## Setup

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To build:

```bash
bun run build
```

To run:

```bash
bun run start
```
